# Evliya-analysis

## Project Abstract

The aim of this research is to spatially analyze the textual narrative of the Book of Travels by
Evliya Ã‡elebi (1611-1685)  for remapping uncharted territories of the physical and social realms of the
Ottoman urban geography to elucidate some of the unexplored aspects of the landscape as a product of
physical and cultural human conception and allow comparative perspectives towards a new research field
that creates a link between integrated values of space and cultural heritage.
